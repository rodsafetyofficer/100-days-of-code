# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 17, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I was able to read an article in freecodecamp about the #100daysofcode challenge and I liked it so I started to commit to the group.

### Day 2: May 18, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on myCheatSheet Website on CodepEn

**Thoughts**: I am still visualizing how I would make this site a place for me to use to look up code and some important tips from tutorials and sites I've been through so that I can go back to it when I need to recall and re-use some of it in my future designs.

### Day 3: May 19, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I was able to finish my C# course in SOLOLEARN.com

**Thoughts**: I'm still having a difficult time understanding some of the concepts of C# even though I've finished the course I'm still going to need to go back and re do a lot of the topics so that I can further understand and remember the syntax and how the structure of C# works.

### Day 4: May 20, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I'm completing my log in #100dayscodechallenge and continuing myCheatSheet site and I took up a mySQL course in SOLOLEARN. I also watched a video tutorial on how to use github forks. I'm currently trying to understand the script of a login form and created a pen in codepen to try it out. 

**Thoughts**: I'm not yet that familiar with github so I had to watch videos about forking and I'm thinking about how to make a login form and how I can use SQL for maintaining a database of records.
